**Gashishnik — High-performance RAC protocol server implementation in Rust**

Gashishnik is a server implementation of the Real Address Chat (RAC) protocol, developed by Mr. Sugoma and promoted as the "IRC Killer," designed to manage text-based communication between clients.

## Features
- TLS support (encrypts client-server communication; requires client TLS support)
- Server-side message sanitization (removes ANSI control characters and other unwanted input from clients)
- Password hashing via bcrypt
- SQLite storage with configurable database file
- Authentication-only mode
- RAC and WRACv2.0 protocol support

## Default ports

| Mode  | Insecure (no TLS) | TLS Enabled |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| RAC   | 42666           | 42667       |
| WRAC  | 52666           | 52667       |

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure you have the following installed:

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)

## Steps to Build

1. Clone the repository:

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OctoBanon-Main/gashishnik.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gashishnik
```

2. Build the project:

To compile the project, run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled executable will be available in the `/target/release/` directory.

## Usage

Run in default RAC mode:
```bash
./target/release/gashishnik-server -a 0.0.0.0
```

Run with TLS:
```bash
./target/release/gashishnik-server -a 0.0.0.0 --tls-cert server.crt --tls-key server.key
```

Run in WRAC (WebSocket) mode:
```bash
./target/release/gashishnik-server -a 0.0.0.0 --mode wrac
```

Run WRAC with TLS:
```bash
./target/release/gashishnik-server -a 0.0.0.0 --mode wrac --tls-cert server.crt --tls-key server.key
```

Run in authentication-only mode (applies to both RAC and WRAC):
```bash
./target/release/gashishnik-server -a 0.0.0.0 --auth-only
```

**Mode summary:**

- RAC – default TCP-based protocol (one request per connection).
- WRAC – WebSocket-based protocol, allows persistent connections.
- Auth-only – disables unauthenticated message sending in both modes.
